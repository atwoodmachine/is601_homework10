### Issue 1: API inaccuracy
In the video, an issue was demonstrated where the API documentation displayed inconsistent information in the nickname fields of the user registration where mismatched. This was originally due to the fact that in the user_schemas.py file, the nickname examples all called generate_nickname(), which randomly assigned a nickname every time the docs page was viewed. This was fixed by changing the example text to a consistent value, which helps developers by making the API clearer and accurate to its actual functionality. Here is the link to the [closed issue](https://github.com/atwoodmachine/is601_homework10/issues/1).
